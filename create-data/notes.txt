0) Install the font you want to create synthetic line image on the system. 
(i.e., Copy the fonts you want to use in the "/usr/share/fonts".)

1) Collect many words in a file called complete.wordlist; Find unique characters and move them to a file:
sed -e "s/./\0\n/g" complete.wordlist | sort -u > unique_chars.txt

2) See the unique_chars.txt file and remove unwanted characters from the complete.wordlist.

3) Split words, such that every word be in a separate line, remove repeated words, and removeblank lines:
tr ' ' '\n' < complete.wordlist > temp.wordlist
sort temp.wordlist| uniq -u > complete.wordlist

4) Shuffle the word list; I uesd below command in the terminal to shuffle words:
(Note that the each words in the fas-all.wordlist should be in a separate line and also be unique.)
cat complete.wordlist | shuf > complete-shuffled.wordlist

5) Replace new line character with the space character:
tr "\n" " " <complete-shuffled.wordlist > temp.wordlist && rm complete-shuffled.wordlist && mv temp.wordlist complete-shuffled.wordlist

6) Create line contents:
awk -v ll="$line_length" '{for (i=1; i<=NF; ++i)printf "%s%s", $i, i % 15 ? " ": "\n"}i % 15{print ""}' complete-shuffled.wordlist > data/lines.txt

7) Install pango-view package:
apt install libpango1.0-dev

8) Run the python script to create image/gt pairs:
python3 create-line-gt-pairs.py
